Once you click, XOOPS opens the Blocks view. MyMenus module has as default only one block, but you can clone it as many times as you like.

As first, you should "activate" the block. 

You can also drag the block to specific location, where you would like to show it to your visitors. 

Finally, you can edit, or delete the block.
